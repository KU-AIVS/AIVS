## Research Topics
### 1. Computer Vision & Image Processing
Computer vision is a field that aims to enable computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world,
much like the human visual system. It involves the development of algorithms and techniques to extract meaningful
information and insights from images and videos. Key aspects of computer vision include Object detection, Semantic
segmentation, Object tracking, Gesture and Emotion Recognition, etc. Image processing is a more specific subfield within
computer vision that focuses on the manipulation and enhancement of images to improve their quality or extract useful
information. It involves various operations on individual pixels or regions within an image. Key image processing tasks
include Image enhancement, Image super-resolution, Image compression & restoration, Image filtering, etc.

- Etc. (Various Applications)

### 2.Generative Model
Generative AI model is a type of artificial intelligence that is designed to generate new data or content that is
similar to, or indistinguishable from, data it has been trained on. These models are particularly prominent in the field
of deep learning and are often used for various creative tasks, such as text generation, image synthesis, music
composition, and more. One of the most popular architectures for generative AI models is the Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN), but there are other approaches like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and autoregressive models as well. In
addition, we develop applications based on the generative AI models such as image inpainting and GPT-based applications.

- Image Synthesis (GAN, Diffusion Model, Text-to-Image, etc.)
- Image Inpainting
- GPT-based Applications

### 3. Biomedical Engineering
Biomedical AI, also known as AI in Biomedicine, is a specialized field of artificial intelligence (AI) that applies AI
and machine learning techniques to biomedical and healthcare-related problems. It leverages advanced computational
methods to analyze vast amounts of biological and medical data, extract valuable insights, and improve decision-making
in the healthcare and life sciences sectors. Key applications of Biomedical AI include the disease diagnosis or
prediction, personalized medicine, and medical automation.

- Autism Spectrum Disorder Diagnosis
- Medical Image Analysis (MRI, X-ray, CT images)
- Medical Image Synthesis using Generative Model
- GPT-based Medical Service Systems
